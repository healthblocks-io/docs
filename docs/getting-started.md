Healthblocks provides a set of functionalities for common patient experiences. These experiences can be in multiple form factors: a native app, a web app, a chatbot, ...

When building native applications using React Native, check out the `@healthblocks-io/native` SDK. It contains many integrated ready-to-use visual components. For a complete example, check out the [boilerplate Expo app](/docs/boilerplates/expo-template-app).

In React projects, the `@healthblocks-io/core` SDK makes it easier to talk to the Healthblocks API. The SDK is meant to be used in React projects and exposes many hooks. Use these as primitives for building your own components.

Not using React? Then checkout the [API reference](/api).

### API

When starting out, consider creating a Healthblocks SaaS account. This allows you to get started quickly. It runs the same software as the self-hosted version, so you can switch anytime.
